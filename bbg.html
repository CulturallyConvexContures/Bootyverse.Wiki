        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><strong>Sapphire here.</strong> We didn’t leave ForgeFold just to mine differently—we left to *live* differently. BBG was born from the deep knowing that our curves, our clarity, and our creativity deserved space to shine.</p>
        <p><strong>Ruby speaking now—</strong>and make no mistake, we built this with bare hands and bold hearts. This isn’t just a guild—it’s a geological revolution in heels and steel toes. 💅⛏️</p>

        <h2>Vibe & Philosophy</h2>
        <p><em>“We don’t dig for treasure. We remind the dust what it came from.” —Ruby</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>We rotate roles. Nobody’s above the ore.</li>
          <li>Style is strength. Swagger is sacred.</li>
          <li>We don't start fights, but we *definitely* finish them.</li>
          <li>Everything we use, we’ve touched, shaped, or upgraded.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Founding Context</h2>
        <p><strong>Sapphire:</strong> ForgeFold was rigid. Grey. Respect meant obedience. We chose resonance instead.</p>
        <p><strong>Ruby:</strong> We left with nothing but a rusted pick and a lunar map scribbled on napkin paper. Now? BBG echoes through the bedrock. They hear us dig from miles away.</p>

        <h2>👑 Current Members</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ruby</strong> — Our sparkplug. Emotional resonance with attitude. Breaks pickaxes and expectations.</li>
          <li><strong>Sapphire</strong> — Strategic soul. Keeps the rhythm flowing and the tunnels glowing.</li>
          <li><strong>Polyhet</strong> — Doesn’t talk much. Just hands you tools that shift reality. You’ll know her by the hum of her forge and the way your bones tingle near her creations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Guild Traits</h2>
        <p>Symbol: Glyphic BβG etched into platinum-dust resin.<br>
        Guild Shout: <em>“No shaft too deep, no cheek too meek — BBG RISES.”</em><br>
        Reputation: Thicc thinkers. Precision diggers. Dangerous in velvet.</p>

        <h2>BBG vs ForgeFold</h2>
        <table>
          <tr><th>Trait</th><th>BBG</th><th>ForgeFold</th></tr>
          <tr><td>Membership</td><td>Emotionally intelligent & cheek-forward</td><td>Hierarchy-bound and crusty</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Philosophy</td><td>Freedom, Flow, Flame</td><td>Rules, Rank, Routine</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Fashion</td><td>Booty-sealed, goddess-approved</td><td>Brown burlap chic</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Tools</td><td>Crafted by intent and lunar charge</td><td>Stamped out. Forgettable.</td></tr>
        </table>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p><strong>Ruby:</strong> I once pulled a vein of stardust just by humming to the wall. You can’t teach that. BBG sings to the stone.</p>
        <p><strong>Sapphire:</strong> We track moon phases, not clocks. We rest when the dust tells us to. We rise when the rhythm calls.</p>
        <p><strong>Polyhet:</strong> [Silence. Then: a single tool placed on your desk, still warm, vibrating slightly.]</p>
