        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Syndicate of Villatic Vixens (SVV)</strong> turns soil into fruits with thicc vibes and balanced nutrients. 
        Farming in the Bootyverse isn’t just planting and watering — it’s <em>alchemical agriculture</em>. 
        Every seed holds memory, and **redaxted by the Buttress..**
        </p>

        <h2>Inputs & Compost System </h2>
        <p>Seeds are bought, gifted, or **redaxted by the Buttress..** 
        Compost combines ingredients from across the Bootyverse:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Mining</b> → **redaxted by the Buttress..**</li>
          <li><b>Fishing</b> → **redaxted by the Buttress..**</li>
          <li>**redaxted by the Buttress..**</li>
          <li><b>Alchemy</b> → Tinctures, **redaxted by the Buttress..**</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each compost carries chemical tags (N, P, K, **redaxted by the Buttress..**). 
        Crops react differently based on balance:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>High-N</b> → Boosts leafy greens</li>
          <li><b>Ca-rich</b> → Strengthens fruiting plants</li>
          <li><b>S + P + tincture</b> → **redaxted by the Buttress..**</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Outputs🍑</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Vegetables & Grains:</b> carrots, corn, wheat, potatoes</li>
          <li><b>Fruits & Trees:</b> apples, plums, citrus (late-game)</li>
          <li><b>Herbs:</b> mint, mandrake, dreamleaf (for alchemy)</li>
          <li><b>Special Crops:</b> prismachrome blooms, **redaxted by the Buttress..**</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Alien Seed System </h2>
        <p>Thanks to <strong>FiddleFax’s expeditions</strong>, new alien compounds enter the mix — 
        birthing plants that glow, hum, and rewrite biology:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>**redaxted by the Buttress..**</b> — Glows faintly, thrives on sulfur.</li>
          <li><b>**redaxted by the Buttress..**</b> — Only grows beneath full moons.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Seeds are extracted through <strong>SeeSee’s Seed Extractor Machine</strong>. 
        Eat the fruit for clarity, or sacrifice it for future growth — the eternal loop of patience and payoff.
        </p>

        <h2>Seasonal Soilglyph Blessings </h2>
        <p>On the first day of each Bootyverse season, 
        **redaxted by the Buttress..**:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>🌞 **redaxted by the Buttress..** — Blaze Spiral:</b> +Yield for heat-loving crops</li>
          <li><b>🌕 **redaxted by the Buttress..** — Mooncoil:</b> +Flavor & XP, crops sparkle under moonlight</li>
          <li><b>🌑 **redaxted by the Buttress..** — Shadow Whorl:</b> +Growth speed for roots & herbs</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>“The soil remembers more than we do,”</em> SeeSee whispers, 
        tracing a glyph with her spade. 
        <em>“It knows when it’s time to reward those who listen.”</em></p>

        <h2>Notable NPCs</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>SeeSee</b> — Curve Curator & Archivist; records compost experiments and crop lore.</li>
          <li><b>FiddleFax</b> — Tinkerer & explorer; brings alien seeds from her cosmic journeys.</li>
          <li><b>Zoe</b> — A patient soul from earth.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Philosophy & Flavor</h2>
        <p><em>“We don’t farm food. We cultivate curves.”</em></p>
        <p>Nothing is waste — **redaxted by the Buttress..**
        SVV teaches that patience is power, 
        and that growth comes to those who harmonize with the Bootyverse’s **redaxted by the Buttress..**</p>
