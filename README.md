# 🍑 Bootyverse.Wiki™

> “You found it, babe. The color-coded, cheek-scribed thicc manual they didn’t want you to read."

> -**Mango Moxie**💋, Art Dojo Instructor, Curator of Curves™

Welcome to the Bootyverse.Wiki™ a cheek-coded archive of **early-game systems, starter modules, and mythic mechanics**.  
Here, you’ll find **deep dives into the first few weeks of gameplay**, covering:

- Essential resources (Dust, Stardust, base ores & minerals, early crops and fish)
- Core upgrades, tools, and rigs
- First-loop lore, glyphs, and goddesses
- Systems within systems (timers, synergy, guild functions)
- 💋 Guild-based entries authored in-character

This isn't just “how to play.”  
This is **why it spirals.**

## 💬 A Final Note from Mango Moxie💋

> “You won’t just learn how the Bootyverse works.  
> You’ll feel why it *had* to be this cheeky.  
> Every system’s a spell. Every spell’s a loop.  
> Every loop’s a vibe.”
