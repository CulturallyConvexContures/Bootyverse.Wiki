# 🍑 Bootyverse.Wiki™

> “You found it, babe. The thicc manual they didn’t want you to read.  
> From spectral pets to Stardust politics — it’s all in here, color-coded and cheek-scribed.”  
> — **Mango Moxie**, Art Dojo Instructor, Curator of Curves™

Welcome to the Bootyverse.Wiki™ — a cheek-scribed archive of **early-game systems, starter modules, and mythic mechanics**.  
Here, you’ll find **deep dives into the first few weeks of gameplay**, covering:

- 📦 Essential resources (Dust, Stardust, base ores, early crops and fish)
- 🛠️ Core upgrades, tools, and rigs
- 🌀 First-loop lore, glyphs, and goddesses
- 🔧 Systems within systems (timers, synergy, guild functions)
- 💋 Guild-based entries authored in-character

This isn't just “how to play.”  
This is **why it spirals.**

## 💬 A Final Note from Mango Moxie💋

> “You won’t just learn how the Bootyverse works.  
> You’ll feel why it *had* to be this cheeky.  
> Every system’s a spell. Every spell’s a loop.  
> Every loop’s a vibe.”

## 🗂️ Wiki Structure & Scope

This wiki covers:
- The first 3 major modules: **BBG**, **SVV**, and **SAS**
- All **early ores, crops, fish, and related tools**
- **Foundational upgrades** and how they spiral forward
- Core **mechanic overviews**, **timers**, and **synergies**
- Flavorful **quotes and guild lore**

🌒 Later-game content, planets, and modules (like the **BootyCade™**, **BootyBank™,** or **Spectral Systems**) are briefly mentioned but not yet covered in full. Think of this as **Volume 1**: The Manual They Didn't Want You to Read.
